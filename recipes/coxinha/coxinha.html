    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Coxinha is a popular Brazilian snack made of dough filled with shredded chicken and often cream cheese. The dough is shaped like a teardrop, resembling a chicken drumstick. After being filled, the coxinha is coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried until golden brown. It's known for its crispy exterior and savory filling, making it a favorite at parties, street food stalls, and casual gatherings in Brazil.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour;</li>
        <li>Butter;</li>
        <li>Salt;</li>
        <li>Shredded chicken;</li>
        <li>Onion;</li>
        <li>Garlic;</li>
        <li>Parsley or cilantro;</li>
        <li>Eggs;</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a skillet, sauté the chopped onion (and garlic, if using) until translucent.
            Add the shredded chicken, salt, pepper, and any herbs. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.
            If desired, stir in cream cheese and fresh herbs. Remove from heat and let cool;</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a saucepan, combine chicken broth, butter, and salt. Bring to a boil.
            Gradually add the flour, stirring continuously until a dough forms.
            Cook for a few minutes until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan. Let it cool slightly;</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Coxinha:</strong> Once the dough is cool enough to handle, take a small piece (about the size of a golf ball) and flatten it in your palm.
            Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center, then fold the dough over the filling and shape it into a teardrop or drumstick shape. Ensure the filling is completely sealed inside;</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Coxinhas:</strong> Dip each shaped coxinha into the beaten eggs, then roll in breadcrumbs until fully coated;</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Coxinhas:</strong> Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 350°F (175°C).
            Fry the coxinhas in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
            Remove and drain on paper towels;</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Enjoy your coxinhas hot, with your favorite dipping sauce!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Feel free to customize the filling or try baking them for a lighter option. Enjoy!</p>
