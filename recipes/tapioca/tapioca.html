    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Tapioca is a starchy substance derived from the cassava root, a tuber native to South America. It’s commonly processed into pearls, flour, or flakes and is a popular ingredient in various dishes. In Brazilian cuisine, tapioca is often used to make flatbreads or crepes, which can be filled with sweet or savory fillings. It’s gluten-free and has a chewy texture when cooked, making it a versatile ingredient in both desserts (like tapioca pudding) and savory snacks.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Tapioca flour;</li>
        <li>Water;</li>
        <li>Salt;</li>
        <li>Fillings (that could be savory or sweet).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Tapioca Flour:</strong> If using dry tapioca flour, place it in a bowl. Add a pinch of salt if desired.
            Slowly add water while mixing, until the flour reaches a damp, sandy consistency. This step is optional; you can use dry flour directly;</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat;</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Crepes:</strong> Sprinkle a thin, even layer of tapioca flour onto the heated pan, about 1/4 cup per crepe.
            Use a spatula to spread it evenly into a circular shape, about 6-8 inches in diameter. The flour should stick together;</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cook for about 1-2 minutes, until the edges start to lift and the center looks set. There’s no need to flip; the crepe cooks on one side;</li>
        <li><strong>Add Fillings (optional):</strong> If desired, add your choice of fillings to one half of the crepe. Fold the other half over to cover the fillings;</li>
        <li><strong>Finish Cooking:</strong> Cook for an additional minute until the cheese melts (if using) and the crepe is warm throughout;</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the pan and serve immediately. Enjoy your tapioca crepes hot, with your favorite fillings!</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Feel free to experiment with different flavors and fillings!</p>
