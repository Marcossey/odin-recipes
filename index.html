    <h2>Description:</h2>
    
    <p>Brigadeiro is a beloved Brazilian sweet treat that's a staple at celebrations and gatherings. Its name comes from a Brazilian brigadeiro (a military title), and it was created in the 1940s. The treat is a type of chocolate truffle made from condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and sometimes chocolate. The mixture is cooked until it thickens and then rolled into small balls, which are often coated with chocolate sprinkles.</p>
    
    <p>Brigadeiros are known for their creamy, fudgy texture and rich, sweet flavor. They're a popular choice for birthday parties and other festive occasions in Brazil. Making brigadeiros is relatively simple but requires a bit of attention to get the right consistency. They’re a great example of how Brazilian cuisine turns simple ingredients into something truly special and delightful.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 can of condensed milk;</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of cocoa powder;</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter;</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Workspace:</strong> Lightly butter a plate or tray where you’ll place the brigadeiros once they’re rolled;</li>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> In a medium saucepan, combine the sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter. Stir well to combine;</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Mixture:</strong> Place the saucepan over medium heat. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula to prevent it from sticking and burning;</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Continue cooking until the mixture thickens and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. You should be able to see the bottom of the pan when you scrape the spoon through the mixture. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes;</li>
        <li><strong>Cool the Mixture:</strong> Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat. Transfer it to the prepared plate or tray and let it cool to room temperature. This can take about 30 minutes;</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Brigadeiros:</strong> Once cooled and firmed up, lightly butter your hands. Take small amounts of the mixture and roll them into 1-inch balls;</li>
        <li><strong>Coat with Sprinkles:</strong> Roll each ball in chocolate sprinkles to coat evenly;</li>
        <li><strong>Chill (Optional):</strong> Place the coated brigadeiros on a plate or in a container. You can eat them right away, but they’re often chilled in the refrigerator for a firmer texture.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And there you have it! Delicious, homemade brigadeiros. Enjoy them as a sweet treat or share them with friends and family.</p>
